# JavaScript.


I create some projects using JS to improve my skills and start this wonderful adventure with this language.
## Random color generator
Simple system using `math` function to randomly choose one element from `array` and set it as color.
## Counter
I wanted to use `forEach` and don't multiple `event listeners`. Counter was the best way to do it. I created 3 buttons:

- Decrease
- Clear
- Increase

which allows me to easily `add`, `reset` and `remove` numbers.

## Modal System
I create it to capture my skills and test myself in javascript.
